# MOTReflectionAngle

R-package for simulating MOT (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988) performance of n target objects. The probability of tracking target t0 can be manipulated. The default value is `p_t0 = 0.5`. Given a specific tracking performance as specified with `min_num_correct` (minimum of correctly tracked target objects), lowering this value increases the probilities of the remaining targets. In contrast, increasing this value decreases the probabilities of the remaining targets.
