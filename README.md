# MOTReflectionAngle

R-package for simulating MOT (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988) performance of n target objects. The probability of tracking target t0 can be manipulated. The default value is 0.5. Lowering this value increases the probilities of the remaining targets, because overall tracking performance is constant. In contrast, increasing this value decreases the probabilities of the remaining targets.
